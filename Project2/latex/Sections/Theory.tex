\subsection{The System}
\subsubsection{The Potentials}

The Hamiltonian under investigation describes \(N\) bosons in a potential trap,
and is on the form

\begin{equation*}
H = \sum_{i=1}^{N}\left( \frac{-\hbar^{2}}{2m}\nabla^{2}_{i} + V_{\text{ext}}(\vb{r}_{i})\right) + \sum_{i<j}^{N}V_{\text{int}}(\vb{r}_{i}, \vb{r}_{j})
\end{equation*}

where \(V_{\text{ext}}\) is the external potential of the trap while
\(V_{\text{int}}\) is the internal potential between the particles. 
The external potential has an elliptical form, being anisotropic in the \(z\)-direction:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:2}
V_{\text{ext}}(\vb{r}) = \frac{1}{2}m\left( \omega\left[ x^{2} + y^{2} \right] + \omega_{z}z^{2} \right)
\end{equation}

The internal potential is a hard shell potential, being infinite for distances
where two bosons overlap:

\begin{equation*}
V_{\text{int}} = \begin{cases}
\infty, &\text{for } |r_{i} - r_{j}| \le 0\\
0, &\text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{equation*}

\subsubsection{Non-interacting Case}
For non-interacting bosons in a spherical with \(\beta = 1\) and \(a = 0\) the
system reduces to spherical harmonic oscillators where analytical solutions are
available. The trial wavefunction reduces to simply the product of one body
elements

\newcommand{\psit}{\Psi_T(\vb{r})}
\newcommand{\onebody}{\prod_{i}^{N}\exp{-\alpha\left[\left( x_i^2 + y_i^2 + \beta
		z_i^2\right)\right]}}
\begin{align*}
\psit = \prod_{i}^{N}\exp[-\alpha\left( x_{i}^{2}+y_{i}^{2}+z_{i}^{2} \right)] = \prod_{i}^{N}\exp(-\alpha \abs{r_{i}}^{2})
\end{align*}

while the Hamiltonian reduces to

\begin{align*}
H = \sum_{i}^{N} \frac{-\hbar^{2}}{2m}\nabla_{i}^{2} + \frac{1}{2}m\omega^{2}r_{i}^{2}
\end{align*}

which in natural units is

\newcommand{\lapl}[1]{\nabla_{#1}^2}
\begin{align*}
H = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i}^{N} -\frac{1}{m}\lapl{i} + m\omega^{2}r_{i}^{2}
\end{align*}

Applying the Hamiltonian gives the local energy as

\begin{align*}
E_{L} = \frac{\alpha d}{m} N + \left( \frac{1}{2}m\omega^{2} - \frac{2\alpha^{2}}{m} \right)\sum_{i}^{N}r_{i}^{2}
\end{align*}
where \(d\) is the dimension. As the factor \(\sum r_{i}^{2}\) is always
positive, its term should be minimized, which is accomplished by setting
\(\alpha = \frac{m\omega}{2}\), giving a minimal local energy of

\begin{equation}
E_{L} = \frac{\omega d N}{2}
\label{eq:noninteracting}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Interacting Case}
The local energy for the full interacting case is much more complicated. The
full computation is deferred to appendix~\ref{appendix:le}. The expression
evaluates to

\begin{align*}
E_{L} &= -\frac{1}{2m}\sum_{i}\bigg[4\alpha^{2}\left(  x_{k}^{2}\uvec{i} + y_{k}^{2}\uvec{j} + \beta^{2} z_{k}^{2}\uvec{k}  \right)\\
&-2\alpha(d-1+\beta)\\
&- 4\alpha\left(  x_{k}\uvec{i} + y_{k}\uvec{j} + \beta z_{k}\uvec{k}  \right)
\sum_{l\neq k} \frac{\vb{r}_{k}-\vb{r}_{l}}{r_{kl}}u^{\prime}\left( r_{kl} \right)\\
&+ \sum_{i\neq k}\sum_{j\neq k}\frac{\left( \vb{r}_{k}-\vb{r}_{i} \right)\left( \vb{r}_{k} -\vb{r}_{j} \right)}{r_{ki}r_{kj}}u^{\prime}\left( r_{ki} \right)u^{\prime}\left( r_{kj} \right)\\
&+ \sum_{l\neq k} \left( u^{\prime\prime}\left( r_{kl} \right)  + \frac{2}{r_{kl}}u^{\prime}(r_{kl})\right)\bigg]\\
&+ \sum_{i}V_{\text{ext}}(\vb{r}_{i}) + \sum_{i<j}V_{\text{int}}\left( \vb{r}_{i}, \vb{r}_{i} \right)
\end{align*}

\subsection{Variational Monte Carlo}
In order to find a good candidate wavefunction for a given potential, one can
employ the \textit{variational principle}. One starts by guessing a trial
wavefunction \(\ket{\Psi_{T}}\) and estimating the trial energy, which is
guaranteed to be equal to or higher than the true ground state energy \(E_{0}\):
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:1}
  E_{0} \le E = \frac{\ev{H}{\Psi_{T}}}{\ip{\Psi_{T}}}
\end{equation}

If \(\ket{\Psi_{T}}\) is an eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian, the variance
\(\sigma^{2}\) will be minimal

\begin{equation*}
  \sigma^{2} = \frac{\ev{H^{2}}{\Psi_{T}}}{\ip{\Psi_{T}}} -\left( \frac{\ev{H}{\Psi_{T}}}{\ip{\Psi_{T}}} \right)^{2} = 0
\end{equation*}

The variational principle expands on this idea by letting \(\ket{\Psi_{T}}\) be
a functional class of a \textit{variational parameter} \(\alpha\). By varying
\(\alpha\) one can find the optimal trial wavefunction within the functional
class by minimizing \(\sigma^{2}\). 

Only a small collection of potentials have analytical solution using the
variational principle. For most potentials, one must numerically
integrate~\eqref{eq:1} using Monte Carlo integration.

For a stochastic variable \(x\) with probability density function \(p(x)\), the
average \(\left< x \right>\) is defined as
\begin{equation*}
  \left< x \right> = \int_{\mathbb{R}} xp(x)\dd x
\end{equation*}
By sampling the stochastic variable \(M\) times, the average can be approximated
by 

\begin{equation*}
  \expval{x} = \int_{\mathbb{R}} xp(x)\dd x \approx \frac{1}{M}\sum_{i=1}^{M}x_{i}p(x_{i})
\end{equation*}

Applying this to an observable \(\mathcal{O}\), we have

\begin{align*}
  \expval{\mathcal{O}} &= \ev{\mathcal{O}}{\Psi}\\
                       &= \int \dd \vb{r} \Psi^{*}\mathcal{O}\Psi \\
                       &= \int \dd \vb{r} \abs{\Psi}^{2} \frac{1}{\Psi}\mathcal{O}\Psi\\
  &= \frac{1}{M} \sum_{i=1}^{M}p(\vb{r})\mathcal{O}_{L}
\end{align*}

where \(\abs{\Psi}^{2}\) is defined as the probability density function, and
\(\frac{1}{\Psi}\mathcal{O}\Psi\) the \textit{local operator}.

The local trial energy can then be defined as
\begin{equation*}
  E_{L} =\frac{1}{\Psi_{T}}H\Psi_{T}
\end{equation*}
which can be computed using Monte Carlo integration as

\begin{align*}
  \expval{E_{L}} \approx \frac{1}{M}\sum_{i=1}^{M} p(\vb{r}_{i})E_{L}(\vb{r}_{i})
\end{align*}

The goal is therefore to minimize minimizing \(\sigma^{2} = \expval{E_{L}^{2}} -
\expval{E_{L}}^{2}\) over the variational parameter \(\alpha\).

\subsection{Autoregressive Models}


\subsection{Metropolis-Hastings}

The estimate of the local energy relies on samples from the trial wave function.
To get a physical value, the configuration of the particles must be as physical
and probable. As the configuration achieving this is unknown, the configuration
space must be explore. This is done through Monte Carlo simulation, more
specifically by using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.

At each MC step a single particle is chosen at random, and a change to its
position is proposed by moving it a fixed step length \(\Delta\) and computing the
ratio between new and old probability densities
\begin{align*}
\omega = \frac{P\left( \vb{r}_{r}, \ldots, \vb{r}_{k}^{*}, \ldots, \vb{r}_{n} \right)}{P\left( \vb{r}_{r}, \ldots, \vb{r}_{k}, \ldots, \vb{r}_{n} \right)}
=  \frac{\left| \Psi_{T}\left( \vb{r}_{r}, \ldots, \vb{r}_{k}^{*}, \ldots, \vb{r}_{n} \right)\right|^{2}}{\left| \Psi_{T}\left( \vb{r}_{r}, \ldots, \vb{r}_{k}, \ldots, \vb{r}_{n} \right)\right|^{2}}
\end{align*}
where \(\vb{r}^{*}\) denotes a modified position.
If the ratio \(\omega\) is greater
than a
uniformly distributed number \(\theta \in [0, 1]\), the move is accepted.
This ratio can often be reduced analytically to obviate the need for recomputing
the entire probability density each step.


\subsection{Onebody Density}

A useful way to understand a many body system is to integrate over all
dimensions except for one, yielding the \textit{one body density}
\(\rho(\vb{r})\), defined as

\begin{align*}
  \rho( \vb{r} ) = \int \dd \mathbf{r}_{2} \ldots \dd \mathbf{r}_{N} \left| \psit \right|^{2}
\end{align*}

It is a scaled probability density function giving the number of particles
within the volume \(\Delta \vb{r}\) as \(\rho(\vb{r})\Delta \vb{r}\).
By convention the integral over all \(\dd \vb{r}\) yields the total number of
particles in the system, \(N\).
