One particle DNN -
  activation functions, must have continous derivative
  relu vs. tanh
  different architectures, depth vs width
  1D, 2D, 3D(elliptic), one-body density
  NN output, z vs exp(z)
  
RNN-DNN -
  Two particles, shielded Coloumb
    Check ground state energy, one-body density, 1D and 2D
    
  Many particles, "softshell" bosons vs project 1, 1D and 2D
